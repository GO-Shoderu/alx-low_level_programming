These are the list of scripts and what they do respectively

NB: Before running any scripts please execute the command below for each respective scripts
	
	to compile the C programs 
		- gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 _putchar.c name-of-c-file.c -o name-of-c-file
	
	0-puts_recursion.c
		- this C program will output a string recursively
		- you will need to execute the code below to test the script
			 ./0-puts_recursion

	1-print_rev_recursion.c
                - this C program will output a string in reverse recursively
                - you will need to execute the code below to test the script
                         ./1-print_rev_recursion

	2-strlen_recursion.c
                - this C program will return the length of a string calculated recursively
                - you will need to execute the code below to test the script
                         ./2-strlen_recursion

	3-factorial.c
                - this C program will return the factorial of an input calculated recursively
                - you will need to execute the code below to test the script
                         ./3-factorial

	4-pow_recursion.c
                - this C program will return the pow of an input calculated recursively
                - you will need to execute the code below to test the script
                         ./4-pow
